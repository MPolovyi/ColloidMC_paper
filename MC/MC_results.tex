\section{Results}
\subsection{Simulation details}

Defining $\rho = \frac{N D}{L}$ where $N$ --- number of particles and $D = \Delta z_{min}$ --- particle diameter, we immediately obtain the simulation system size $L = N D/ \rho$. In our simulations we considered three cases of different densities $\rho = (0.25,\ 0.5,\ 0.95)$.

\textcolor{red}{diameter calculated numerically minimized function. Should I explain it? Not analytically because I'm better with computer than math. And I calculate it every run to get system size}

\textcolor{yellow}{it seems that you need to solve a transcendental equation to obtain the minimum. Thus, you have no way to get it analytically, i.e., the equation cannot be inverted.}

\textcolor{red}{So what should I write here, if at all?}

To check for existence of finite-size effects, for each value of density we perform simulations with different particle numbers $N = (500,\ 5000)$. \textcolor{red}{I've already said that I do it for different density, should I say that I do it for different size instead?}

The simulations were allowed to equilibrate for $\Delta = 5 \cdot 10^5$ sweeps (one sweep consists of $N$ Monte-Carlo test steps), and after that every $\Delta$ sweeps were generated ensemble-averaged quantities, obtaining that way $10$ uncorrelated samples.

We measured the following quantities:

Nematic order parameter $S$ is defined as:
\begin{equation}
\label{eq:nematic_order_parameter}
	S = \frac{3 \langle\cos^2 \theta\rangle - 1}{2}
\end{equation}
where $\theta$ it the angle between particle dipole moment and spatial axis, while horizontal bar denotes ensemble average.

We also measured the orientation correlation as a function of the distance between particles:
\begin{equation}
	C(\Delta z) = \langle \cos \theta_1 \cos \theta_2\rangle \propto |\Delta z|
\end{equation}
where $\theta_1$ and $\theta_2$ are angles between spatial axis and dipole moments of particles which centers are separated by $\Delta z$ distance.

We measure the average chain length, where chain is a sequence of chained particles and two particles considered to be "chained" if 
\begin{equation}
\begin{cases}
	|z_1 - z_2| &\leq d \\
	\cos \theta_1 \cdot \cos \theta_2 &\geq 0
\end{cases}
\end{equation}

\subsection{Obtained results}
\label{subsec:obtained_results}
Here we look into comparison of results obtained through Monte-Carlo and Langevin Dynamics simulations. First of all, the dependence of order parameter defined by \eqref{eq:nematic_order_parameter} of the $k_BT$ is of interest. The Figure \ref{fig:op_kbt} may suggest that Monte Carlo simulations are struck in local minima, but from the Figure \ref{fig:op_from_coaligned} it is clear that Langevin dynamics simulations are relaxing towards the MonteCarlo results

Important to notice that relaxation of the order parameter towards equilibrium if system is started from fully aligned state first taakes leap towards less-aligned state and then gradually increases towards the Monte-Carlo result.
