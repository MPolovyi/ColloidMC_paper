\section{Monte Carlo Simulations}

We first study the equilibrium properties by means of Monte Carlo simulations.

At every Monte Carlo step we choose one particle at random and attempt first a translational and then a rotational move. In the translational move a particle is displaced along the z-axis ($z_{t+1} = z_t + \delta z$), where $\delta z$ is a random value uniformly distributed in the range $[+\eta, -\eta]$, with $\eta = 0.5 (\Delta z_{min} - \Delta z_0)$. Here $\Delta z_{min}$ is distance between two particles with co-aligned dipole moments on which the potential energy is minimal, and $\Delta z_0$ is the distance where potential energy becomes zero if we decrease distance starting from $\Delta z_{min}$ \textcolor{red}{In other words, we finding the minima, then we are moving to the left from minima, and as soon as energy becomes zero or above, we say that it's $\Delta z_0$. Off course I'm solving the equation numerically in the code, but it's the easiest way to explain I can come up with}. For the rotational move a new orientation is chosen uniformly at random. A move is accepted with probability $ \mathrm{min} \left\{1, \, \exp(\epsilon^*\Delta E) \right\}$, where $\eta$ is a random number uniformly-distributed in $[0, 1)$, $\Delta E$ is change in system potential energy due to test step (rotation and translation), and $\epsilon^* = \epsilon/k_B T$.

For the sake of simplicity we restrict interactions to the two closest neighbors.

We considered periodic boundary conditions.
