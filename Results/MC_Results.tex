\subsection{Equilibrium results}
\label{subsec:monte_carlo_results}
First we look into relation between order parameter~\eqref{eq:nematic_order_parameter} and $k_BT$ at equilibrium for different system densities. As we can see on the Figure~\ref{fig:op_kbt}, the nematic order increases with decrease of $k_BT$. Black color shows results for $N = 6400$ and red color for $N = 1600$ particles. Lines show results obtained by means of Monte-Carlo simulations, and points are obtained from Langevin dynamics simulations allowed to equilibrate for $t = 500$. The results are average over $200$ samples. Important to observer rapid increase in order parameter in low temperature. The region of rapid increase shifts with densities, and for higher density the relation between order parameter and $k_BT$ closer to linear. As we can see, there is no systematic scaling with system size, and both MC and LD results are in good agreement.

Growth of nematic order parameter with decrease of temperature may imply structural changes in observed system. To investigate that, we first calculate the probability of having two chains pointing in the same direction (along or counter $z$ axis) or in opposite directions for different $k_BT$.

Next we analyse the orientation correlation (i.e. the level of co-alignment) of particles as function of distance between them. For all observed range of simulation parameters the correlation (i.e. co-alignment between dipole moments of two particles) decays exponentially with distance. For selected number of simulation parameters the results are presented at the Figure \ref{fig:dist_corr_eq}, done in log-linear scale. The dots are obtained with space sampling $\delta = 1/6$, and are averaged over $200$ samples with $N = 6400$ particles. Lines are obtained by linear approximation of the results in range $0.01 < C(\Delta z) < 0.45$.

We could now write $C(\Delta z)$ as
\begin{equation}
	\label{eq:slopes_def}
	C(\Delta z) \propto \exp^{A(k_BT, \rho) \Delta z}
\end{equation}
where $A$ is a function of system density and $k_BT$. If we look at the dependence of $A$ on the $k_BT$ for different system densities, we obtain the results shown at the Figure \ref{fig:dist_corr_eq_slopes}. For the high density $\rho = 0.75$ the \textcolor{red}{coefficient A} exhibits linear behaviour over all range of $k_BT$, while for the lower values of density the dependence consists of two linear regimes, with the transition occurring in the vicinity of $k_BT = 1.5$. On the Figure \ref{fig:dist_corr_eq_slopes} the dotted lines are the linear approximation in the range $k_BT \in (0.6, 1.5]$ while the solid lines show the approximation in range $k_BT \in (1.5, 3]$.

Defining ``chain'' we can distinguish three cases for the separation distance $d$. First being $d \ll R$ where $R$ is particle radius. That way we effectively treat all particles as ``unchained''. Second case is when $D \leq d < 2 D$, in which the ``chained'' particles form a compact cluster. And the third case is $d \sim L$, where $L$ is system size, in which the ``chain'' breaks only if particles orientations are not co-aligned with $z$ axis and each other.
