abstract = {We propose an efficient algorithm to sample the volume in Monte Carlo simulations in the isobaric-isothermal ensemble. The method is designed to be applied in the simulation of hard-core models at high density. The algorithm is based in the generation of clusters of particles. At the volume change step, the distances between pairs of particles belonging to the same cluster do not change. This is done by rescaling the positions of the center of mass of each cluster instead of the position of each individual particle. We have tested the performance of the algorithm by simulating fluid and solid phases of hard spheres, finding that in both cases the algorithm is much more efficient than the standard procedure. Moreover, the efficiency of the method measured in terms of correlation "time" does not depend on the system size in contrast with the standard method, in which the sampling becomes rapidly inefficient as the system size increases. We have used the procedure to compute with high precision the equation of state of the face-centered-cubic phase of the hard sphere system for different system sizes. Using these results we have estimated the equation of state at the thermodynamic limit. The results are compared to different equations of state proposed in literature.},

abstract = {We continue to study out of equilibrium TFT with switching on the interaction occurring at finite time. We exploit the concept of projected function (PF) and Wigner transform of projected function (WTPF). WTPF's are bare propagators, one-loop self-energies, retarded and advanced components of the resummed propagator. Among WTPF's convolution product is very simple, one does not need gradient expansion. However, WTPF's are completely determined by their infinite time limit and, thus, cannot be the carriers of relaxation phenomena. Furthermore, we observe that the functions capable of carrying relaxation phenomena (non-WTPF) emerge in the mixed ("ill-defined") products of retarded and advanced propagators and self-energies. In particular, only non-WTPF's contribute to time variation of equal-time Green functions (particle number, etc.); contributions from WTPF will be constant in time. As these are generated in mixed products, the pinching phenomenon is being promoted from an obstacle to the central feature of out of equilibrium TFT. We analyze the pinching phenomenon. In the case of naive pinching we reproduce known results. In Schwinger-Dyson equations the Keldysh component of self-energy is well defined even for multiple self-energy insertion contributions. We calaculate explicitly single self-energy contribution to Keldysh component of propagator which generates nontrivial time dependence. For photon production from QCD plasma (finite-lifetime effect) our approximate analytic results agree with the results by S. -Y. Wang and D. Boyanovsky obtained within dynamical renormalisation group approach.},

abstract = {We introduce numerical methods for simulating the diffusive motion of rigid bodies of arbitrary shape immersed in a viscous fluid. We parameterize the orientation of the bodies using normalized quaternions, which are numerically robust, space efficient, and easy to accumulate. We construct a system of overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion, and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of which ensure the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing near a no-slip boundary, and demonstrate the importance of the choice of tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near a bottom wall due to gravity. For several particle shapes we find a choice of tracking point that makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method. However, in general such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long timescales.},

abstract = {Patchy particles are a class of colloids with functionalized surfaces. Through surface functionalization, the strength and directionality of the colloidal interactions are tunable allowing control over coordination of the particle. Exquisite equilibrium phase diagrams of mixtures of coordination two and three have been reported. However, the kinetics of self-organization and the feasibility of the predicted structures are still largely unexplored. Here, we study the irreversible aggregation of these mixtures on a substrate, for different fractions of two-patch particles. Two mechanisms of mass transport are compared: diffusion and advection. In the diffusive case, an optimal fraction is found that maximizes the density of the aggregate. By contrast, for advective transport, the density decreases monotonically with the fraction of two-patch colloids, in line with the behavior of the liquid density on the spinodal of the equilibrium phase diagram.},

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are in many respects very similar to real experiments. In MD, first, sample is prepared, a model system consisting of N particles is selected, and then Newton's equations of motion are solved for the system until the properties of the system no longer change with time. To measure an observable quantity in a MD simulation, one must first of all be able to express this observable as a function of the positions and momenta of the particles in the system. The best introduction to MD simulations is to consider a simple program. To start the simulation, one should assign initial positions and velocities to all particles in the system. The particle positions should be chosen compatible with the structure that one is aiming to simulate. A good MD program requires a good algorithm to integrate Newton's equations of motion. Accuracy for large time steps is more important because the longer the time step that one can use, the fewer evaluations of the forces are needed per unit of simulation time. For most MD applications, Verlet-like algorithms are perfectly adequate. However, sometimes it is convenient to employ a higher-order algorithm.},

abstract = {For many years, the Luttinger liquid theory has served as a useful paradigm for the description of one-dimensional (1D) quantum fluids in the limit of low energies. This theory is based on a linearization of the dispersion relation of the particles constituting the fluid. Recent progress in understanding 1D quantum fluids beyond the low-energy limit is reviewed, where the nonlinearity of the dispersion relation becomes essential. The novel methods which have been developed to tackle such systems combine phenomenology built on the ideas of the Fermi-edge singularity and the Fermi-liquid theory, perturbation theory in the interaction strength, and new ways of treating finite-size properties of integrable models. These methods can be applied to a wide variety of 1D fluids, from 1D spin liquids to electrons in quantum wires to cold atoms confined by 1D traps. Existing results for various dynamic correlation functions are reviewed, in particular, the dynamic structure factor and the spectral function. Moreover, it is shown how a dispersion nonlinearity leads to finite particle lifetimes and its impact on the transport properties of 1D systems at finite temperatures is discussed. The conventional Luttinger liquid theory is a special limit of the new theory, and the relation between the two is explained.},

We take into account the excluded-volume interactions between denaturated loops and the rest of the chain by exploiting recent results on scaling properties of polymer networks of arbitrary topology. The phase transition is found to be first order in d = 2 dimensions and above, in agreement with experiments and at variance with previous theoretical results, in which only excluded-volume interactions within denaturated loops were taken into account. Our results agree with recent numerical simulations.},

AB bonding results in the formation of a three-dimensional network of the particles and AA and BB bonding promotes chain formation. The theory is applied to study the phase behaviour of the model at different values of the potential model parameters. Competition between network and chain formation gives rise to a re-entrant phase behaviour with upper and lower critical points. The model with an additional van der Waals type of interaction may have a re-entrant phase diagram with three critical points and two separate regions of the liquid-gas phase coexistence. We analyze our results in terms of the fractions of the particles in different bonding states and conclude that re-entrant phase coexistence can be seen as a coexistence between a gas phase rich in chain ends and a liquid phase rich in branch points.},

abstract = {The widely used Arrhenius equation describes the kinetics of simple two-state reactions, with the implicit assumption of a single transition state with a well-defined activation energy barrier DeltaE, as the rate-limiting step. However, it has become increasingly clear that the saddle point of the free-energy surface in most reactions is populated by ensembles of conformations, leading to nonexponential kinetics. Here we present a theory that generalizes the Arrhenius equation to include static disorder of conformational degrees of freedom as a function of an external perturbation to fully account for a diverse set of transition states. The effect of a perturbation on static disorder is best examined at the single-molecule level. Here we use force-clamp spectroscopy to study the nonexponential kinetics of single ubiquitin proteins unfolding under force. We find that the measured variance in DeltaE shows both force-dependent and independent components, where the force-dependent component scales with F(2), in excellent agreement with our theory. Our study illustrates a novel adaptation of the classical Arrhenius equation that accounts for the microscopic origins of nonexponential kinetics, which are essential in understanding the rapidly growing body of single-molecule data.},

abstract = {In this paper, a new theory is developed for the self-assembly of associating molecules confined to a single spatial dimension, but allowed to explore all orientation angles. The interplay of the anisotropy of the pair potential and the low dimensional space results in orientationally ordered associated clusters. This local order enhances association due to a decrease in orientational entropy. Unlike bulk 3D fluids which are orientationally homogeneous, association in 1D necessitates the self-consistent calculation of the orientational distribution function. To test the new theory, Monte Carlo simulations are performed and the theory is found to be accurate. It is also shown that the traditional treatment in first order perturbation theory fails to accurately describe this system. The theory developed in this paper may be used as a tool to study hydrogen bonding of molecules in 1D zeolites as well as the hydrogen bonding of molecules in carbon nanotubes.},

abstract = {We study the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relations, Dt=kBT/6pietaR and Dr=kBT/8pietaR3, where Dt and Dr are the translational and rotational diffusivity, respectively, T is the temperature, eta the viscosity, kB the Boltzmann constant, and R the "molecular" radius. Our results are based on molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point charge model of water. We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and dynamical heterogeneities (DHs), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for subsets of the 7{\%} "fastest" and 7{\%} "slowest" molecules. We find that the SE and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with "fractional" SE and SED relations, Dt approximately (tau/T)-xit and Dr approximately (tau/T)-xir, where xit approximately 0.84({\textless}1) and xir approximately 0.75({\textless}1). We also find that there is a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this decoupling occurs in both the fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. Further, we find that, the decoupling increases upon cooling, but that the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns originate at a time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DHs are more relevant. Our work also demonstrates that selecting DHs on the basis of translational or rotational motion more strongly biases the calculation of diffusion constants than other dynamical properties such as relaxation times.},

Using line optical tweezers, we quantify the dynamics of two DNA-coated microspheres as a function of DNA density and strength of the DNA-induced pair interaction potential. At high DNA density, the binding kinetics is limited by the rate of microsphere diffusion and displays the expected dependence on the interaction potential energy. At low DNA density, the particle binding kinetics is set by single molecular binding events and exhibits bound times having a non-exponential distribution, suggesting that individual DNA bridges may also have intrinsic non-exponential kinetics. A dynamic model that includes such dispersion in the lifetimes of molecular bridges reproduces our observations, while an alternative model based on fluctuations in DNA density does not.},

We show that, as the energy cost $\epsilon$(j) of forming Y-junctions increases, the extent of the liquid-vapour coexistence region at lower temperatures and densities is reduced. The phase diagram thus acquires a characteristic "pinched" shape in which the liquid branch density decreases as the temperature is lowered. To our knowledge, this is the first model in which the predicted topological phase transition between a fluid composed of short chains and a fluid rich in Y-junctions is actually observed. Above a certain threshold for $\epsilon$(j), condensation ceases to exist because the entropy gain of forming Y-junctions can no longer offset their energy cost. We also show that the properties of these phase diagrams can be understood in terms of a temperature-dependent effective valence of the patchy particles.},

abstract = {We calculate the equilibrium thermodynamic properties, percolation threshold, and cluster distribution functions for a model of associating colloids, which consists of hard spherical particles having on their surfaces three short-ranged attractive sites (sticky spots) of two different types, A and B. The thermodynamic properties are calculated using Wertheim's perturbation theory of associating fluids. This also allows us to find the onset of self-assembly, which can be quantified by the maxima of the specific heat at constant volume. The percolation threshold is derived, under the no-loop assumption, for the correlated bond model: In all cases it is two percolated phases that become identical at a critical point, when one exists. Finally, the cluster size distributions are calculated by mapping the model onto an effective model, characterized by a--state-dependent--functionality f and unique bonding probability p. The mapping is based on the asymptotic limit of the cluster distributions functions of the generic model and the effective parameters are defined through the requirement that the equilibrium cluster distributions of the true and effective models have the same number-averaged and weight-averaged sizes at all densities and temperatures. We also study the model numerically in the case where BB interactions are missing. In this limit, AB bonds either provide branching between A-chains (Y-junctions) if epsilon(AB)/epsilon(AA) is small, or drive the formation of a hyperbranched polymer if epsilon(AB)/epsilon(AA) is large. We find that the theoretical predictions describe quite accurately the numerical data, especially in the region where Y-junctions are present. There is fairly good agreement between theoretical and numerical results both for the thermodynamic (number of bonds and phase coexistence) and the connectivity properties of the model (cluster size distributions and percolation locus).},

@article{Virnau2004,
abstract = {We consider an implementation of umbrella sampling in which the pertinent range of states is subdivided into small windows that are sampled consecutively and linked together. This allows us to simulate without a weight function or to extrapolate the results to the neighboring window in order to estimate a weight function. Additionally, we present a detailed error analysis in which we demonstrate that the error in umbrella sampling is controlled and, in the absence of sampling difficulties, independent of the window sizes. In this case, the efficiency of our implementation is comparable to a multicanonical simulation with a very good weight function, which in our scheme does not need to be known ahead of time. The analysis also allows us to detect sampling difficulties such as correlations between adjacent windows and provides a test of equilibration. We exemplify the scheme by simulating the liquid-vapor coexistence in a Lennard-Jones system.},

@article{Wang2001,
abstract = {We present a new Monte Carlo algorithm that produces results of high accuracy with reduced simulational effort. Independent random walks are performed (concurrently or serially) in different, restricted ranges of energy, and the resultant density of states is modified continuously to produce locally flat histograms. This method permits us to directly access the free energy and entropy, is independent of temperature, and is efficient for the study of both 1st order and 2nd order phase transitions. It should also be useful for the study of complex systems with a rough energy landscape.},

@article{Wertheim1984,
abstract = {The formalism of statistical thermodynamics developed in the preceding paper is used as a basis for deriving tractable approximations. The system treated is one where repulsion and highly directional attraction due to a single molecular site combine to allow the formation of dimers, but no higher s-mers. We derive thermodynamic perturbation theory, using the system interacting with only the repulsive potential as a reference system. Two distinct integral equations for the pair correlation are derived. The first one treats both parts of the interaction approximately; the other one employs the repulsive reference system used in perturbation theory. We show that each of these integral equations permits the calculation of an important thermodynamic function directly from the solution at a single state of density and temperature. In the first case this applies to a pressure consistent with the compressibility relation, in the second to the excess Helmholtz free energy over the reference system.},

@article{Zhao2013,
abstract = {There are three main frameworks to describe the orientation and rotation of non-spherical particles: Euler angles, rotation matrices and unit Quaternions. Of these methods, the latter seems the most attractive for describing the behaviour of non-spherical particles. However, there are a number of drawbacks when using unit Quaternions: the necessity of applying rotation matrices in conjunction to facilitate the transformation from body space to world space, and the algorithm integrating the Quaternion should inherently conserve the length of the Quaternion. Both drawbacks are addressed in this paper. The present paper derives a new framework to transform vectors and tensors by unit Quaternions, and the requirement of explicitly using rotation matrices is removed altogether. This means that the algorithm derived in this paper can describe the rotation of a non-spherical particle with four parameters only. Moreover, this paper introduces a novel corrector-predictor method to integrate unit Quaternions, which inherently conserves the length of the Quaternion. The novel framework and method are compared to a number of other methods put forward in the literature. All the integration methods are discussed, scrutinised and compared to each other by comparing the results of four test cases, involving a single falling particle, nine falling and interacting particles, a 2D prescribed torque on a sphere and a 3D prescribed torque on a non-spherical particle. Moreover, a convergence study is presented, comparing the rate of convergence of the various methods. All the test cases show a significant improvement of the new framework put forward in this paper over existing algorithms. Moreover, the new method requires less computational memory and fewer operations, due to the complete omission of the rotation matrix in the algorithm. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},
