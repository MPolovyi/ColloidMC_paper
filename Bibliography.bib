abstract = {We introduce numerical methods for simulating the diffusive motion of rigid bodies of arbitrary shape immersed in a viscous fluid. We parameterize the orientation of the bodies using normalized quaternions, which are numerically robust, space efficient, and easy to accumulate. We construct a system of overdamped Langevin equations in the quaternion representation that accounts for hydrodynamic effects, preserves the unit-norm constraint on the quaternion, and is time reversible with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution at equilibrium. We introduce two schemes for temporal integration of the overdamped Langevin equations of motion, one based on the Fixman midpoint method and the other based on a random finite difference approach, both of which ensure the correct stochastic drift term is captured in a computationally efficient way. We study several examples of rigid colloidal particles diffusing near a no-slip boundary, and demonstrate the importance of the choice of tracking point on the measured translational mean square displacement (MSD). We examine the average short-time as well as the long-time quasi-two-dimensional diffusion coefficient of a rigid particle sedimented near a bottom wall due to gravity. For several particle shapes we find a choice of tracking point that makes the MSD essentially linear with time, allowing us to estimate the long-time diffusion coefficient efficiently using a Monte Carlo method. However, in general such a special choice of tracking point does not exist, and numerical techniques for simulating long trajectories, such as the ones we introduce here, are necessary to study diffusion on long timescales.},

abstract = {Particle-based simulations are performed to study the post-relaxation dynamics of functionalized (patchy) colloids adsorbed on an attractive substrate. Kinetically arrested structures that depend on the number of adsorbed particles and the strength of the particle-particle and particle-substrate interactions are identified. The radial distribution function is characterized by a sequence of peaks{\{},{\}} with relative intensities that depend on the number of adsorbed particles. The first-layer coverage is a non-monotonic function of the number of particles{\{},{\}} with an optimal value around one layer of adsorbed particles. The initial relaxation towards these structures is characterized by a fast (exponential) and a slow (power-law) dynamics. The fast relaxation timescale is a linearly increasing function of the number of adsorbed particles in the submonolayer regime{\{},{\}} but it saturates for more than one adsorbed layer. The slow dynamics exhibits two characteristic exponents{\{},{\}} depending on the surface coverage.},

An analysis of appropriate short-time correlation functions provides direct access to the hydrodynamic friction tensor of the particles revealing nontrivial couplings between the translational and rotational degrees of freedom.

@article{Marshall2015,
abstract = {In this paper, a new theory is developed for the self-assembly of associating molecules confined to a single spatial dimension, but allowed to explore all orientation angles. The interplay of the anisotropy of the pair potential and the low dimensional space results in orientationally ordered associated clusters. This local order enhances association due to a decrease in orientational entropy. Unlike bulk 3D fluids which are orientationally homogeneous, association in 1D necessitates the self-consistent calculation of the orientational distribution function. To test the new theory, Monte Carlo simulations are performed and the theory is found to be accurate. It is also shown that the traditional treatment in first order perturbation theory fails to accurately describe this system. The theory developed in this paper may be used as a tool to study hydrogen bonding of molecules in 1D zeolites as well as the hydrogen bonding of molecules in carbon nanotubes.},

@article{Mazza2007,
abstract = {We study the Stokes-Einstein (SE) and the Stokes-Einstein-Debye (SED) relations, Dt=kBT/6pietaR and Dr=kBT/8pietaR3, where Dt and Dr are the translational and rotational diffusivity, respectively, T is the temperature, eta the viscosity, kB the Boltzmann constant, and R the "molecular" radius. Our results are based on molecular dynamics simulations of the extended simple point charge model of water. We find that both the SE and SED relations break down at low temperature. To explore the relationship between these breakdowns and dynamical heterogeneities (DHs), we also calculate the SE and SED relations for subsets of the 7{\%} "fastest" and 7{\%} "slowest" molecules. We find that the SE and SED relations break down in both subsets, and that the breakdowns occur on all scales of mobility. Thus these breakdowns appear to be generalized phenomena, in contrast with a view where only the most mobile molecules are the origin of the breakdown of the SE and SED relations, embedded in an inactive background where these relations hold. At low temperature, the SE and SED relations in both subsets of molecules are replaced with "fractional" SE and SED relations, Dt approximately (tau/T)-xit and Dr approximately (tau/T)-xir, where xit approximately 0.84(<1) and xir approximately 0.75(<1). We also find that there is a decoupling between rotational and translational motion, and that this decoupling occurs in both the fastest and slowest subsets of molecules. Further, we find that, the decoupling increases upon cooling, but that the probability of a molecule being classified as both translationally and rotationally fastest also increases. To study the effect of time scale for SE and SED breakdown and decoupling, we introduce a time-dependent version of the SE and SED relations, and a time-dependent function that measures the extent of decoupling. Our results suggest that both the decoupling and SE and SED breakdowns originate at a time scale corresponding to the end of the cage regime, when diffusion starts. This is also the time scale when the DHs are more relevant. Our work also demonstrates that selecting DHs on the basis of translational or rotational motion more strongly biases the calculation of diffusion constants than other dynamical properties such as relaxation times.},
