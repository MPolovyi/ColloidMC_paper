abstract = {We continue to study out of equilibrium TFT with switching on the interaction occurring at finite time. We exploit the concept of projected function (PF) and Wigner transform of projected function (WTPF). WTPF's are bare propagators, one-loop self-energies, retarded and advanced components of the resummed propagator. Among WTPF's convolution product is very simple, one does not need gradient expansion. However, WTPF's are completely determined by their infinite time limit and, thus, cannot be the carriers of relaxation phenomena. Furthermore, we observe that the functions capable of carrying relaxation phenomena (non-WTPF) emerge in the mixed ("ill-defined") products of retarded and advanced propagators and self-energies. In particular, only non-WTPF's contribute to time variation of equal-time Green functions (particle number, etc.); contributions from WTPF will be constant in time. As these are generated in mixed products, the pinching phenomenon is being promoted from an obstacle to the central feature of out of equilibrium TFT. We analyze the pinching phenomenon. In the case of naive pinching we reproduce known results. In Schwinger-Dyson equations the Keldysh component of self-energy is well defined even for multiple self-energy insertion contributions. We calaculate explicitly single self-energy contribution to Keldysh component of propagator which generates nontrivial time dependence. For photon production from QCD plasma (finite-lifetime effect) our approximate analytic results agree with the results by S. -Y. Wang and D. Boyanovsky obtained within dynamical renormalisation group approach.},

abstract = {Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations are in many respects very similar to real experiments. In MD, first, sample is prepared, a model system consisting of N particles is selected, and then Newton's equations of motion are solved for the system until the properties of the system no longer change with time. To measure an observable quantity in a MD simulation, one must first of all be able to express this observable as a function of the positions and momenta of the particles in the system. The best introduction to MD simulations is to consider a simple program. To start the simulation, one should assign initial positions and velocities to all particles in the system. The particle positions should be chosen compatible with the structure that one is aiming to simulate. A good MD program requires a good algorithm to integrate Newton's equations of motion. Accuracy for large time steps is more important because the longer the time step that one can use, the fewer evaluations of the forces are needed per unit of simulation time. For most MD applications, Verlet-like algorithms are perfectly adequate. However, sometimes it is convenient to employ a higher-order algorithm.},

Thus it is noted that the same equation of state of hard sphere fluid is obtained when one used the ``integral condition'' as when the ``infinity condition'' is used. We have then applied the theory to study the thermodynamic properties, in particular the equation of state, of the rigid sphere fluid in two and one dimensions. The approximate equation of state of the two‐dimensional rigid sphere fluid is in good agreement over the range of fluid densities with the results of the machine Monte Carlo calculations by Jacobson and Wood and dynamical machine calculations of Wainwright and Alder.

For simplicity, we consider that the patches on each species are identical: one species has three patches of type A and the other has two patches of type B. We have found a rich phase behavior with closed miscibility gaps, liquid-liquid demixing, and negative azeotropes. Liquid-liquid demixing was found to pre-empt the "empty" fluid regime, of these mixtures, when the AB bonds are weaker than the AA or BB bonds. By contrast, mixtures in this class exhibit "empty" fluid behavior when the AB bonds are stronger than at least one of the other two. Mixtures with bonding energies $\epsilon$(BB) = $\epsilon$(AB) and $\epsilon$(AA) < $\epsilon$(BB), were found to exhibit an unusual negative azeotrope.},

The theory is applied to study the phase behaviour of the model at different values of the potential model parameters. Competition between network and chain formation gives rise to a re-entrant phase behaviour with upper and lower critical points. The model with an additional van der Waals type of interaction may have a re-entrant phase diagram with three critical points and two separate regions of the liquid-gas phase coexistence. We analyze our results in terms of the fractions of the particles in different bonding states and conclude that re-entrant phase coexistence can be seen as a coexistence between a gas phase rich in chain ends and a liquid phase rich in branch points.},

The interplay of the anisotropy of the pair potential and the low dimensional space results in orientationally ordered associated clusters. This local order enhances association due to a decrease in orientational entropy. Unlike bulk 3D fluids which are orientationally homogeneous, association in 1D necessitates the self-consistent calculation of the orientational distribution function. To test the new theory, Monte Carlo simulations are performed and the theory is found to be accurate. It is also shown that the traditional treatment in first order perturbation theory fails to accurately describe this system. The theory developed in this paper may be used as a tool to study hydrogen bonding of molecules in 1D zeolites as well as the hydrogen bonding of molecules in carbon nanotubes.},

The phase diagram thus acquires a characteristic "pinched" shape in which the liquid branch density decreases as the temperature is lowered. To our knowledge, this is the first model in which the predicted topological phase transition between a fluid composed of short chains and a fluid rich in Y-junctions is actually observed. Above a certain threshold for $\epsilon$(j), condensation ceases to exist because the entropy gain of forming Y-junctions can no longer offset their energy cost. We also show that the properties of these phase diagrams can be understood in terms of a temperature-dependent effective valence of the patchy particles.},

abstract = {We calculate the equilibrium thermodynamic properties, percolation threshold, and cluster distribution functions for a model of associating colloids, which consists of hard spherical particles having on their surfaces three short-ranged attractive sites (sticky spots) of two different types, A and B. The thermodynamic properties are calculated using Wertheim's perturbation theory of associating fluids. This also allows us to find the onset of self-assembly, which can be quantified by the maxima of the specific heat at constant volume. The percolation threshold is derived, under the no-loop assumption, for the correlated bond model: In all cases it is two percolated phases that become identical at a critical point, when one exists. Finally, the cluster size distributions are calculated by mapping the model onto an effective model, characterized by a--state-dependent--functionality f and unique bonding probability p. The mapping is based on the asymptotic limit of the cluster distributions functions of the generic model and the effective parameters are defined through the requirement that the equilibrium cluster distributions of the true and effective models have the same number-averaged and weight-averaged sizes at all densities and temperatures. We also study the model numerically in the case where BB interactions are missing. In this limit, AB bonds either provide branching between A-chains (Y-junctions) if epsilon(AB)/epsilon(AA) is small, or drive the formation of a hyperbranched polymer if epsilon(AB)/epsilon(AA) is large. We find that the theoretical predictions describe quite accurately the numerical data, especially in the region where Y-junctions are present. There is fairly good agreement between theoretical and numerical results both for the thermodynamic (number of bonds and phase coexistence) and the connectivity properties of the model (cluster size distributions and percolation locus).},

In this case, the efficiency of our implementation is comparable to a multicanonical simulation with a very good weight function, which in our scheme does not need to be known ahead of time.

abstract = {The formalism of statistical thermodynamics developed in the preceding paper is used as a basis for deriving tractable approximations. The system treated is one where repulsion and highly directional attraction due to a single molecular site combine to allow the formation of dimers, but no higher s-mers. We derive thermodynamic perturbation theory, using the system interacting with only the repulsive potential as a reference system. Two distinct integral equations for the pair correlation are derived. The first one treats both parts of the interaction approximately; the other one employs the repulsive reference system used in perturbation theory. We show that each of these integral equations permits the calculation of an important thermodynamic function directly from the solution at a single state of density and temperature. In the first case this applies to a pressure consistent with the compressibility relation, in the second to the excess Helmholtz free energy over the reference system.},
